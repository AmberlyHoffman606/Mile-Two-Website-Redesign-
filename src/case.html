      Let's do it again then, what the heck. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Let your heart be your guide. And just raise cain. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.

      If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Let's have a nice tree right here. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Put it in, leave it alone. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.
