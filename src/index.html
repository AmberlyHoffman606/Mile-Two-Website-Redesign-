      <h2>DEVELOPEMENT</h2>
        <p>Brown is such a nice color. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>
      <h2>APPLIED RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Only eight colors that you need. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>
      <h2>CONSULTING</h2>
        <p>And just raise cain. Very easy to work these to death. You can do anything your heart can imagine. This piece of canvas is your world. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.

      <h2>TASK ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>
        This painting comes right out of your heart. Now then, let's play. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You need the dark in order to show the light. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We'll play with clouds today.

    <h1>OUR WORK</h1>
    <h3>Project #1</h3>
     <img class="p1" /> <!--FOR CELL IMAGE-->
     <p>This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. </p>
    <h3>Project #2</h3>
  <img class="p2" /> <!--FOR CELL IMAGE-->
      <p>
   I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue There we go. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.
      </p>
    <h3>Project #3</h3>
     <img class="p3" /> <!--FOR CELL IMAGE-->
     <p>
       Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
