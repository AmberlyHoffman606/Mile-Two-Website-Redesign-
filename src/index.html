              <p class="serv_p">Brown is such a nice color. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>

              <p class="serv_p">I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Only eight colors that you need. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>

      <h3>Project #1</h3>
      <p>
        You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. There comes a nice little fluffer.<a href="#">Click Here</a>

      <h3>Project #2</h3>
      <p>
        We'll play with clouds today. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.<a href="#">Click Here</a>

      <h3>Project #3</h3>
      <p>
        Just beat the devil out of it. You are only limited by your imagination. Here's something that's fun. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.<a href="#">Click Here</a>
