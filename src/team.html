    <h1>MANIFESTO</h1>
    <p>
      You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your
      spouse. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

      <h3>Innovation</h3>
      <p>
        We think that there’s no problem we can’t solve with equal parts of intelligence and creativity. We build business tools by using novel and divergent thinking. We use the most cutting-edge technologies to create the optimal team of the human and machine.

      <h3>Customization</h3>
      <p>
        There are no one-size-fits-all solutions out there. Business tools should be built the way you work rather than the way we work. But don’t worry... “custom” does not have to mean “outrageously expensive.”
