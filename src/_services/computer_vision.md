From concept to implementation, Mile Two researched and implemented computer vision algorithms into real-world solutions. Leveraging open source tools and our ability to take algorithms into production, we developed a pupil detector capable of tracking both pupils at a time and providing value to our customer who integrated the algorithm into a commercial application.
