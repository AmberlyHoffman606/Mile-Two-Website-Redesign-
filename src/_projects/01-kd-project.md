para_1: KD was designed as an interactive platform that enables laboratories to inventory intellectual property, present inventions to entrepreneurs and industry, and gain a rich understanding of commercial potential and pathways to market through intelligent reporting. It has become a discovery platform for inventors, industrialists, capitalists, entrepreneurs, and the generally curious.
para_2: TNEBULA forms the connective tissue between our region’s small businesses, larger corporations, and laboratories so that collaboratively we can drive innovation and introduce real products into the market. We work with labs all over the country and allow our network of entrepreneurs, technical, and industry experts, and students to collaborate and produce some amazing data, giving us real insight into the health of our country’s innovation pipeline.
intro: We built a mobile-first web application that allows investors, innovators, and entrepreneurs to connect around cutting-edge research.
