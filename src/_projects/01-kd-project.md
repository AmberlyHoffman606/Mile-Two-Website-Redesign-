para_1: Knowledge Discovery is focused on supporting the geospatial analyst at NASIC. The project documents current manual and automated content capture, identifying gaps where capture techniques are not currently utilized. Using direct observation (knowledge elicitation) and process tracing techniques and conceptual design seeds, we explore ways to integrate with or supplement current tools to better support the analytic process. The team creates conceptual tool designs for the analyst to use now while envisioning the analytic environment of the future.
para_2: KD explored the application of a function-based approach to intelligence analysis, showing how this would complement Structured Observation Management (SOM) and Activity Based Intelligence (ABI) methods currently being implemented. This new approach provides a vision for where GSI intelligence analysis could be in 5-10 years. This envisioning is complemented by building a proof of concept tool to aid analysts in working with the event models used for indications and warnings. While fundamentally pragmatic, this tool also supports SOM integration and the knowledge capture necessary to support the analyst both now and in the future.
