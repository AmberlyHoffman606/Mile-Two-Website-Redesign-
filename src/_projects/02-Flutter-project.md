intro: A consumer-friendly app patients can use to educate themselves about their heart health, have more meaningful interactions with their PCP, and see just how much impact small lifestyle changes can have on their heart health.
para_1: Shrouded by jargon and bureaucracy, the average person isn’t comfortable confidently navigating the medical space. Information is presented in an overwhelming, unabridged format with an unnecessary formal tone. Flutter bridges the gap between professional and layman by offering a streamlined but still knowledge-rich cardiac health resource in colloquial terms. Supported by strong comprehensive research, Flutter offers incredible value to the scientific & medically-inclined about cardiac risk. We believe that by going commercial, we can offer all the value Flutter offers to those on the other side of the spectrum - the patients.
para_2: Our favorite thing about CDVi was the immediate response given upon input. We wanted to stay true to this experience, so it was paramount that we make Flutter as ‘alive’ as possible. In addition, the biggest user trend we noticed in our market research was that users don’t always have the requested medical info. To make their Flutter experience as easy and engaging as possible, we included built in conveniences as much as we could. Finally, Flutter would be the first app in the heart care space where users could have an interactive area to project lifestyle changes and see the results. This was another tribute to CDVi and we hope that by being presented with realistic and achievable milestones, this will facilitate conversation between the patient and their doctor about how to best implement those lifestyle changes.
