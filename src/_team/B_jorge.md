 Jorge has architected and implemented software for much of his career. Notable projects have involved FPGAs, cyber security, geospatial representations, parsing, algorithm development, and integration. After much planning, in 2015, Jorge left his contractor job with AFRL and co-founded Mile Two to work on solving interesting problems and the trend is still ongoing. Prior to dedicating to Mile Two full-time Jorge also supported the community with his involvement in the local bike co-op, Bicycles for All. In his free time, he enjoys biking, listening and playing music, and spending time with his family.
